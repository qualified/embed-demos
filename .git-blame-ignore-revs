# Comments stolen from https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/master/.git-blame-ignore-revs
# GitHub supports this file to exclude these commits from the blame view.
#
# You can easily exclude big automated code changes by running
#
#     git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
#
# in your local repository. It will work also in IDE integrations.
#
# On versions of Git 2.20 and later comments (#), empty lines, and any leading and
# trailing whitespace is ignored. Everything but a SHA-1 per line will error out on
# older versions.
#
# You should add new commit hashes to this file when you create or find such big
# automated refactorings while reading code history. If you only know the short hash,
# use `git rev-parse 1d5abf01` to expand it to the full SHA1 hash needed in this file.
